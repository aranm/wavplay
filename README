SYNOPSIS
=========

::

 #include "wavplay.h"

 void
 wav_play(const char *filename);

 int
 snd_init(void);

 void
 snd_end(void);

DESCRIPTION
============

The ``wav_play()`` function opens and plays a WAV sound file. If ``snd_init()`` is not called before, ``wav_play()`` will initialize the OSS sound device. Until the ``snd_end()`` is called manually or the program is quit, the device reminds open. 

The default OSS device is `/dev/dsp`, which can be defined through the macro ``DEV_NODE``. For each call to ``wav_play()``, the device will be reseted; sound mixing is available if your OSS supports it.

RETURN VALUES
==============
If successful, ``snd_init()`` returns a non-negative integer.

BUGS
=====

This library only supports standard, little-endian WAV file without a AIFF fact chunk.
